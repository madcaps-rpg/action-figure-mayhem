___

### House Rule Examples

#### Cover
* Some structures may be used as cover. 
* Heavy structures have 2d6 hit points with a minimum of 6.
* Normal structures 1d6 hitpoints. 
* If a Player attacks from cover and is hit, the Player takes 1/3 damage rounded up or any damage over the cover's hit points whichever is lower. 
        
#### Turkey Day Mayhem
* The Gravy Boat has 4d6 hit points with a minimum of 12.
* Green Bean Casserole poison effect if used for cover. 1/2 1d6 rounded up damage to Heroes or Mobs per to round of cover. 
* Serving Dishes count as Heavy Strctures
* Fried Turkeys get a 2d6 Ranged Attack on the Baddie at the end of each round. 
           
#### Shields
* Each player starts with a 2 bonus hit points as a shield.
* Melee attacks ignore this bonus.
* If the player's hit points drop to 0 but the shield still has 2 bonus points it is converted to 1 hit point and the player survives. 

#### Explosive Ranged Ammo
* The damage for this ammo is 2d6. 
* The player only has 3 charges
* After 3 charges, the player can no longer range attack.

#### Wandering Monsters
* For every round that a house pet is on the table, the Baddie gets an additional 1d6 attack per round for each "Wandering Monster".
* When a Wandering Monster attacks a physical item on the table and in play, the item takes 1d6 damage. 

#### High Chair Offense
* Flip a coin, vote, or have a fun challenge to determine who rolls for a Toddler at the table. The Toddler counts as an extra 1d6 attack to whoever controls it. 
* Toddlers are automatically Mobs and controlled by the Baddie with 6 or more total Players. 

#### The No Fractions Rule
* Don't do any math to determine the damage for a house rule; just take the roll value.
